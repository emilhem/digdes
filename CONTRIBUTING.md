## Making Changes

On GitHub you can make changes by pressing edit on the top right of a
page/source you want to change.

For more advanced users you probably should fork my project, add a
patch-branch and make a pull request of the changes that you want to make.

## Before making a pull request

1. Make sure that you use UNIX line endings (git usually fixes this for you
automatically on Windows).
2. Make sure that you use UTF-8 encoding.
3. Make sure that you use 4 spaces and definitely not tabs.
4. [Test](#Testing) the code where possible.

## Testing

Testing is useful for catching those hard to spot bugs. Currently no
tests are provided but you should provide testable code for any commits
that you provide.
